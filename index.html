  <h2 id="line">About the Movie</h2>
  <p>Riely Thames, a 26-year-old fashion graduate in New Jersey, works for a well-known women's clothing brand where 
      her ideas are repeatedly dismissed by executives. Though talented, constant criticism chips away at her confidence, 
      leaving her stuck running errands instead of designing. Fed up, she quits and launches her own inclusive fashion line. 
      As her debut runway approaches, her former company sabotages her by booking her models and leaking her designs to competitors. 
      With time running out and her reputation on the line, Riely rebuilds her collection from the start, assembling a new team and 
      refining her vision. On the night of the runway, she steps forward, not just as a designer, but as the brand itself, unaware 
      of how far this moment is about to take her.
